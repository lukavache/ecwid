# APi project is Backend, check it's readme to run it in docker
# WEB is Frontend, also check it's readme
# run both project: docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
# To run them locally, use 'npm run dev' on each project after build.
# Main branch has vanilla vue/node setup with custom ecwid elements in it, Stage has embeded one, which is unclear for me and maybe it needs clarification.
